# Task-03: Hellow World!

## How I approached the task

The code was simple in the main languages like c, cpp, go, java, javascript, rust and python.

Ruby and haskell syntax is vastly different from the rest but it was manageable to get them running in the online compiler without spending too much time.

I faced difficulty in elixir because it wasn't working in the online compiler, so I decided to not take user input and assign a value to the range.
