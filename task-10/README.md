# Task-10: RuskOS

## How I approached the task

Even though you don't have to edit or add more than 15 lines of code, getting familiar with the syntax of rust code used to develop kernels did take a while.

After figuring out how to build the project and making the .cargo/config.toml file, the rest of the task was pretty straightforward. Changing the background colour to black and correcting the inverted text input became simple after getting familiar with the syntax of loops and IO functions in rust
