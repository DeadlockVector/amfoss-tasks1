## Intro
Hey amFOSS team, I've learnt a lot about different kinds of development over the last semester while mostly focusing on android app dev. I also want to learn how to and start contributing to open source projects soon. My favourite pass-times are basketball and speedcubing.

## Why must we choose you?
I'm really interested in learning how to contribute to open source platforms and I'll also max out my effort in contributing to the club projects and activities. Joining amFOSS has been a goal since I've joined here and I'd love to be part of the community.

## What is your plan for the next 6 months? How will you accomplish them?
- Improve in problem solving for competitive programming and attend contests
- Learn different data structures and algorithms through leetcode/codeforces
- Understand the basics of Ai/Ml dev 
 
## How would you contribute back to the club?
I'll prioritise the tasks and projects assigned to me and I'm looking forward to continue the legacy that AmFoss built over the years.
I'm ready to stay back after class as required by the club and will put in my all during competitions and hackathons.

## Feedback on the Selection Process
Its certainly very intimidating for someone without a background in computer science but I assume pravesham is more than just about completing the tasks, its also about learning how to learn and overcome errors(google it till you make it). The tasks also give us an intro on different kinds of applications we can develop and the variety in the field of CS. Overall its a solid selection process to test who all actually want to join the club seriously and get better.
