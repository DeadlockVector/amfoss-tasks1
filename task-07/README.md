# Task-07: Chrome Extension (AK47)

## How I approached the task:

The html code for popup.html and the script to call the API was the main part of this task. A youtube tutorial was enough to get started on the manifest.json file to upload it locally to google chrome. Making the body of the extension was basic html and css.
