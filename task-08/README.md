# Task-08; PokeSearch

## How I approached the task

The main part was completing the back-end and adding a new window to display the captured pokemons. PySide6 syntax is simple and I was able to create the new window and connect the buttons to their respective functions by referring to the partially completed code.

I had forgotten to add a .gitignore file to prevent the virtual environment from getting pushed into the repo so that took a while to fix.

Didn't face any other problems and obstacles while completing the task other than the that.
