Overall a really fun task, similar to praveshan 2022's difficulty level. I could finish most of them without many hiccups but the solution for The Labyrinth's riddle took the most amount of time as my first approach did not satisfy all the test cases.

Also the sample test case for Alchemy's Pinnacle isn't satisfied but I'm still getting a score of 10/10.

The others were mostly based on finding patterns and coming up with solutions, I also loved a lot of the references in the questions.
