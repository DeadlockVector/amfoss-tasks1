# Task-11: TinkerCAD

## Automatically Retractable Roof

This task was fairly simple, tinkercad's interface is simple to use and making the connections was a breeze.

We also had an arduino course in sem 1 and sem 2 where we built similar applications so I was already familiar with arduino programming using c++.
