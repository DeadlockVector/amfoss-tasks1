# Task-06: Discord bot

## How I approached the task

I started out with setting up the bot on the discord developers page and then making the bot.py file and setting up its basic functions which wasn't very complex.

Scraping the information from ESPN was confusing because the page had a lot of nested ```<div>``` elements. Getting the team name, number of overs and score took a while because of this and the various possible cases (ie. first innings, no live matches, etc).
