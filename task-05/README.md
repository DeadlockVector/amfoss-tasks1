# Task-05: Imagine Dragons

## How I approached the task

Since its a static website, basic html and css was only required to create the landing page and the shopping page. I faced some difficulty trying to get the footer to stick to the bottom of the page to imitate the image given in the task.

Formatting each element in the shopping page also took some time as the css wasn't straightforward.

Overall its a great task for an introduction to html, css and js.
