# Task-09: GeoQuest

## How I approached the task

Before the semester 2 exams, I was working with two of my friends on a skill-exchange app, made using flutter and dart so I'm familiar with flutter widgets and app development in general using dart.

The documentation of open street maps was easy to understand and getting the app to show the user's location didn't take much time. OSM also has pre-defined fucntions to understand how the user interacts with the map.

I had a hiccup trying to draw the route from the user's location to the destination because I missed the ```.drawRoad()``` function in the documentation and I spent couple of hours going through OSRM and google maps api documentation.
